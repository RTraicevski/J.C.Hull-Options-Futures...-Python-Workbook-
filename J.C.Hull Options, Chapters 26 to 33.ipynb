    "### The Constant Elasticity of Variance Model\n",
    "This is a diffusion model where the risk-neutral process for a stock price S is\n",
    "$$dS=(r-q)Sdt+\\sigma S^{\\alpha}dz$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where r is the risk-free rate, q is the dividend yield, dz is a Wiener process, $\\sigma$  is a volatility parameter, and $\\alpha$ is a positive constant\n",
    "\n",
    "When alpha = 1, the CEV model is the geometric Brownian motion model.\n",
    "\n",
    "When alpha <1, the volatility increases as the stock price decreases. This\n",
    "creates a probability distribution similar to that observed for equities with a heavy left tail and less heavy right tail\n",
    "\n",
    "When alpha > 1, the volatility increases as the stock price increases. This creates a probability distribution with a heavy right tail and a less heavy left tail.\n",
    "\n",
    "This corresponds to a volatility smile where the implied volatility is an increasing function of the strike price. (Volatility is still constant in this model)\n",
    "\n",
    "The CEV model is useful for valuing exotic equity options\n",
    "\n",
    "### Merton's Mixed Jump Diffusion Model\n",
    "Merton has suggested a model where jumps are combined with continuous changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dS}{S}=(r-q-\\lambda k)dt+\\sigma dz + dp$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where dz is a Wiener process, dp is the Poisson process generating the jumps, and  is $\\sigma$ the volatility of the geometric Brownian motion. The processes dz and dp are assumed to be independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model gives rise to heavier left and heavier right tails than Black–Scholes–Merton. It can be used for pricing currency options.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Variance-Gamma Model\n",
    "An example of a pure jump model. A gamma process is a pure jump process where small jumps occur very frequently and large jumps occur only occasionally\n",
    "\n",
    "the variance-gamma distribution has heavier tails than the lognormal distribution given by geometric Brownian motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance-gamma model tends to produce a U-shaped volatility smile. The\n",
    "smile is not necessarily symmetrical. It is very pronounced for short maturities and ‘‘dies away’’ for long maturities. The model can be fitted to either equity or foreign currency plain vanilla option prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stochastic Volatility Models\n",
    "An alternative to the variance-gamma model is a model where the process followed by the volatility variable is specified explicitly. Suppose first that the volatility parameter in the geometric Brownian motion is a known function of time. The risk-neutral process followed by the asset price is then\n",

    "##### The Black–Scholes–Merton formulas are then correct provided that the variance rate is set equal to the average variance rate during the life of the option \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, volatility varies stochastically. This has led to the development of more complex models with two stochastic variables: the stock price and its\n",

    "$$dV = a(V_{L}-V)dt+\\beta V^{a}dz_{V}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable V in this model is the asset’s variance rate. The variance rate has a drift that pulls it back to a level $V_{L}$ at rate a.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hull and White show that, when volatility is stochastic but uncorrelated with the asset price, the price of a European option is the Black–Scholes–Merton price integrated over the probability distribution of the average variance rate during the life of the option\n",
    "\n",
    "Black–Scholes–Merton overprices options that are at the money or close to the money, and underprices options that are deep-in- or deep-out-of-the-money. The model is consistent with the pattern of implied volatilities observed for currency options\n",

    "provides an exact fit to the European option prices observed on any given day, regardless of the shape of the volatility surface.\n",

    "The risk-neutral process for the asset price in the model has the form,\n",
    "$$dS = [r(t)-q(t)]Sdt+\\sigma (S,t)Sdz$$\n",

    "where r(t) is the instantaneous forward interest rate for a contract maturing at time t and q(t) is the dividend yield as a function of time.

    "The assumption that the short-term interest rate behaves like a stock price is a natural starting point but is less than ideal.

This phenomenon is known as mean reversion\n",

    "### No Arbitrage Models\n",
    "The disadvantage of the equilibrium models we have presented is that they do not automatically fit today’s term structure of interest rates.
